The text below is a set of reviews for my paper. I am writing a response to these reviews.
Please format the reviews into a Markdown document that includes bullet point for each
criticism or question that was made or asked for by the reviewers. For each of these
either include an abridge text from the reviewer. Keep this text pretty short, only one sentence at max. If the text is too long, cut it down to a shorter length. Separate them into clear sections, but keep them in the same order. Below each bullet point include a section that says "Response:"
